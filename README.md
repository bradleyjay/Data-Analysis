# Data-Analysis
Analysis with Pandas and Matplotlib to draw insights from raw Computational Fluid Dynamics data.

## 1) Cooktop_combustion-thermocouples.ipynb
Analysis with Pandas and Matplotlib to determine the convergence time of a large, complex cooktop combustion model simulated with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Thermocouple data is used to determine if the simulation results have converged to a pseudo-steady-state and are usable in data-backed decision making.
